/**
 
 The ABBeaconManager class defines the interface for handling and configuring the April beacons and get related events to your application. You use an instance of this class to establish the parameters that describes each beacon behavior. You can also use a beacon manager object to retrieve all beacons in range.
 
 A beacon manager object provides support for the following location-related activities:
 
 * Monitoring distinct regions of interest and generating location events when the user enters or leaves those regions (works in background mode).
 * Reporting the range to nearby beacons and ther distance for the device.

 *      in the foreground.  If updates have been started when going to the
 *      background, then a status bar banner will be displayed to maintain
 *      visibility to the user, and updates will continue until stopped
 *      normally, or the app is killed by the user.
 *
 *      "When-in-use" authorization does NOT enable monitoring API on regions,
 *      significant location changes, or visits, and -startUpdatingLocation will
 *      not succeed if invoked from the background.

 *      to direct user request for a location-based service so that the reason
 *      for the prompt will be clear.  Any authorization change as a result of
 *      the prompt will be reflected via the usual delegate callback:
 *      -locationManager:didChangeAuthorizationStatus:.
 *
 *      If received, "always" authorization grants access to the user's
 *      location via any CLLocationManager API, and grants access to
 *      launch-capable monitoring API such as geofencing/region monitoring,
 *      significante location visits, etc.  Even if killed by the user, launch
 *      events triggered by monitored regions or visit patterns will cause a
 *      relaunch.
 *
 *      "Always" authorization presents a significant risk to user privacy, and
 *      as such requesting it is discouraged unless background launch behavior
 *      is genuinely required.  Do not call +requestAlwaysAuthorization unless
